## üöÄ Production Deployment (When Ready)

### **Required Steps:**
1. Get production ShipEngine API key (currently using TEST key)
2. Setup real carrier accounts (USPS, UPS, FedEx)
3. Update `.env` with production API key
4. Test with one real shipment
5. Monitor for issues

### **Current Limitations (Test Mode):**
- ‚ùå Labels have "SAMPLE" watermark
- ‚ùå Cannot be used for real shipping
- ‚ùå No real carrier integration
- ‚úÖ Perfect for testing and development

### **Cost Estimates (Production):**
- ShipEngine: $0.05 per label (after free tier)
- USPS shipping: $4-15 per package
- UPS shipping: $10-25 per package
- FedEx shipping: $12-30 per package

## ‚ùì Common Questions

**Q: Why does my label say "SAMPLE"?**  
A: You're using a TEST API key. This is correct for development. Production labels won't have this watermark.

**Q: Can I ship packages with test labels?**  
A: No, test labels are for development only. You need a production API key for real shipping.

**Q: How much does ShipEngine cost?**  
A: Free for 25 labels/month, then $0.05 per label. Shipping costs are separate (paid to USPS/UPS/FedEx).

**Q: Do I need my own USPS/UPS/FedEx accounts?**  
A: Yes, for production. ShipEngine connects to your carrier accounts to create real labels.

**Q: Can I test without real carrier accounts?**  
A: Yes! That's what you're doing now with the TEST API key. Perfect for development.

**Q: What happens when I switch to production?**  
A: Replace TEST API key with production key, and labels will be real (no SAMPLE watermark).

```

### **Rebuild Backend After Changes:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run build
```

### **Restart Backend Server:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### **View Recent Orders with Tracking:**
```sql
SELECT 
  id, 
  order_number, 
  status,
