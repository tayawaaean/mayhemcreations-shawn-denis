## New Flow

### Before (Broken)
```
Cart → Submit Review (no address) → Admin Approval → Checkout → Payment
         ↑
    Shipping: $0.00 (WRONG!)
```

### After (Fixed)
```
Cart → Checkout → Review & Submit → Admin Approval → Payment
         ↓
    Step 1: Get Address
    Step 2: Calculate Shipping ($9.99)
    Step 3: Review Total ($69.39)
    Step 4: Submit with Complete Info ✅
```

SHIPENGINE_ORIGIN_STREET=128 Persimmon Dr
SHIPENGINE_ORIGIN_CITY=Newark
SHIPENGINE_ORIGIN_STATE=OH
SHIPENGINE_ORIGIN_ZIP=43055
SHIPENGINE_ORIGIN_COUNTRY=US

# Database (Should already be set)
DB_NAME=mayhem_creations
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
```

---

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Run database migration on production database
- [ ] Set SHIPENGINE_API_KEY in production environment
- [ ] Update FRONTEND_URL in backend .env
- [ ] Test shipping calculation with production API key
- [ ] Verify ShipEngine account has sufficient credits
- [ ] Set up monitoring for shipping API failures
- [ ] Configure fallback rates for your region
- [ ] Test with international addresses (if supported)
- [ ] Update customer-facing documentation
- [ ] Train admin team on new shipping fields

---

## Monitoring

### Metrics to Track
1. Shipping calculation success rate
2. Average shipping cost per order
3. Most popular carriers selected
4. Checkout abandonment at shipping step
5. ShipEngine API response times
6. Fallback rate usage frequency

### Alerts to Set Up
- ShipEngine API failures > 5% of requests
- Average shipping calculation time > 5 seconds
- Orders submitted without shipping method
- Database shipping field errors

---

## Known Limitations

### Current Version
1. **Product Weights:** Default 8 oz for all products
   - Future: Add weight field to products table
   
2. **International Shipping:** Limited to US addresses
   - Future: Expand to Canada, UK, etc.
   
3. **Multi-Package:** All items in one package
   - Future: Split large orders into multiple packages
   
4. **Insurance:** Not yet available
   - Future: Add shipping insurance option

### Workarounds
- **Custom Weights:** Admin can manually adjust shipping cost if needed
- **International Orders:** Contact customer support for manual quote
- **Large Orders:** System uses maximum package dimensions

---

## Success Metrics

### Customer Metrics
- ⬆️ Checkout completion rate (no shipping surprises)
- ⬇️ Cart abandonment at payment (accurate pricing)

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: Shipping rates not loading

**Symptoms:**
- Loading screen shows indefinitely
- "Failed to calculate shipping" error
- Console shows API error

**Solutions:**
1. Check ShipEngine API key is valid
2. Verify backend server is running
3. Check network tab for failed requests
4. Review backend logs for errors
5. Test ShipEngine status: GET /api/v1/shipping/shipengine/status

### Problem: Migration fails

**Symptoms:**
- "Column already exists" error
- "Table not found" error

**Solutions:**
1. Check if columns already exist:
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
   WHERE table_name='order_reviews';
   ```
2. If exists, skip migration or modify to ALTER IF NOT EXISTS
3. Check database name is correct
4. Verify user has ALTER permissions

### Problem: Order submission fails

**Symptoms:**
- "Missing shipping address" error
- Order not created in database

**Solutions:**
1. Check all address fields are filled
2. Verify shipping method is selected
3. Check browser console for validation errors
4. Review backend logs for validation failures

### Problem: Admin doesn't see shipping info

**Symptoms:**
- Shipping fields show null or undefined
- Address not displayed in admin panel

**Solutions:**
1. Verify order was created AFTER migration
2. Check SELECT query includes new fields
3. Refresh admin panel (clear cache)
4. Check database record has shipping_address populated
