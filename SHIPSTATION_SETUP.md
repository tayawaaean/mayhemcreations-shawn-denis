## üõ†Ô∏è Step 7: Integration with Order Workflow

### 7.1 Automatic Order Creation
When an order is placed in your system, you can automatically create it in ShipStation:

```typescript
// Example: Create order in ShipStation after local order creation
const shipStationOrder = await shipStationApiService.createOrder({
  orderNumber: localOrder.orderNumber,
  orderDate: localOrder.createdAt,
  orderStatus: 'awaiting_shipment',
  billTo: {
    name: localOrder.billingAddress.name,
    street1: localOrder.billingAddress.street1,
    city: localOrder.billingAddress.city,
    state: localOrder.billingAddress.state,
    postalCode: localOrder.billingAddress.postalCode,
    country: localOrder.billingAddress.country
  },
  shipTo: {
    name: localOrder.shippingAddress.name,
    street1: localOrder.shippingAddress.street1,
    city: localOrder.shippingAddress.city,
    state: localOrder.shippingAddress.state,
    postalCode: localOrder.shippingAddress.postalCode,
    country: localOrder.shippingAddress.country
  },
  items: localOrder.items.map(item => ({
    name: item.productName,
    quantity: item.quantity,
    unitPrice: item.price,
    weight: {
      value: item.weight || 1,
      units: 'pounds'
    }
  }))
});
```

### 7.2 Label Generation
Generate shipping labels when orders are ready to ship:

```typescript
// Example: Create shipping label
const label = await shipStationApiService.createLabel({
  carrierCode: 'ups',
  serviceCode: 'ups_ground',
  packageCode: 'package',
  shipDate: new Date().toISOString(),
  weight: {
    value: orderWeight,
    units: 'pounds'
  },
  shipFrom: {
    name: 'Mayhem Creations',
    street1: '123 Business St',
    city: 'Your City',
    state: 'Your State',
    postalCode: '12345',
    country: 'US'
  },
  shipTo: order.shippingAddress
});
```

## üîç Step 8: Troubleshooting

### 8.1 Common Issues

**Issue**: "ShipStation API credentials not configured"
- **Solution**: Check that your environment variables are set correctly
- **Check**: Restart your backend server after adding environment variables

**Issue**: "Connection failed"
- **Solution**: Verify your API key and secret are correct
- **Check**: Test your credentials in ShipStation's API documentation

**Issue**: "Tracking not found"
- **Solution**: Ensure the tracking number is valid and exists in ShipStation
- **Check**: Verify the order was created in ShipStation first

### 8.2 Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting:
```env
NODE_ENV=development
```

This will show detailed logs in your backend console.

### 8.3 API Rate Limits
ShipStation has API rate limits:
- **Sandbox**: 100 requests per minute

If you hit rate limits, the system will automatically retry with exponential backoff.
