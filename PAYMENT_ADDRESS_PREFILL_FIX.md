# ✅ Payment Address Pre-fill Fix

## 🎯 Problem

**Both Stripe and PayPal checkout were not pre-filling the shipping address** with the address from the database ("123 North High Street").

**Your console showed:**
```javascript
shippingAddress: {
  line2: '500',          // ✅ Has apartment
  city: 'Columbus',      // ✅ Has city
  state: 'OH',           // ✅ Has state
  postal_code: '43215',  // ✅ Has zip
  country: 'US',         // ✅ Has country
  // ❌ MISSING line1 (street address)
}
```

## ✅ Solutions Applied

### **1. Frontend - Address Field Normalization**
**File:** `frontend/src/ecommerce/routes/Payment.tsx` (Lines 218-242)

**Problem:** Database stores address with field name `address`, but payment gateways expect `line1`.

**Solution:** Added comprehensive field mapping to handle all possible field name variations:

```typescript
// Parse shipping address
let shippingAddr = typeof order.shipping_address === 'string'
  ? JSON.parse(order.shipping_address)
  : order.shipping_address

console.log('🔍 Raw shipping address from DB:', shippingAddr)
console.log('🔍 Address field names:', shippingAddr ? Object.keys(shippingAddr) : 'null')

// Normalize address field names (handle different formats)
if (shippingAddr) {
  shippingAddr = {
    firstName: shippingAddr.firstName || shippingAddr.first_name || '',
    lastName: shippingAddr.lastName || shippingAddr.last_name || '',
    email: shippingAddr.email || '',
    phone: shippingAddr.phone || '',
    address: shippingAddr.address || shippingAddr.street || shippingAddr.line1 || '',  // ✅ Multiple fallbacks
    apartment: shippingAddr.apartment || shippingAddr.line2 || '',
    city: shippingAddr.city || '',
    state: shippingAddr.state || '',
    zipCode: shippingAddr.zipCode || shippingAddr.zip_code || shippingAddr.postal_code || '',
    country: shippingAddr.country || 'US'
  }
  
  console.log('📍 Normalized shipping address:', shippingAddr)
  console.log('📍 Address field value:', shippingAddr.address)
  
  // Validate critical address fields
  if (!shippingAddr.address || !shippingAddr.city || !shippingAddr.state || !shippingAddr.zipCode) {
    console.error('⚠️ Incomplete shipping address detected:', {
      hasAddress: !!shippingAddr.address,
      hasCity: !!shippingAddr.city,
      hasState: !!shippingAddr.state,
      hasZipCode: !!shippingAddr.zipCode
    })
    showError('Shipping address is incomplete. Please contact support.')
    navigate('/my-orders')
    return
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Handles `address`, `street`, or `line1` field names
- ✅ Handles snake_case (`zip_code`) and camelCase (`zipCode`)
- ✅ Validates all critical fields before proceeding
- ✅ Shows exactly what's in the database via console logs
- ✅ Prevents payment if address is incomplete

### **2. Stripe - Customer Pre-fill Enhancement**
**File:** `backend/src/services/stripeService.ts` (Lines 150-216)

**Problem:** Stripe Checkout doesn't pre-fill addresses from metadata. It only pre-fills from saved customer shipping addresses.

**Solution:** Create or update Stripe customer with shipping address before creating checkout session:

```typescript
// Create or update customer with shipping address to enable pre-fill
let customerId = data.customerId;

if (data.customerInfo && data.shippingAddress) {
  try {
    // Try to find existing customer by email
    const customers = await stripe.customers.list({
      email: data.customerInfo.email,
      limit: 1
    });
    
    const customerData: any = {
      name: data.customerInfo.name,
      email: data.customerInfo.email,
      phone: data.customerInfo.phone || undefined,
      shipping: {                              // ✅ This is the key!
        name: data.customerInfo.name,
        address: {
          line1: data.shippingAddress.line1,   // ✅ Street address
          line2: data.shippingAddress.line2 || undefined,
          city: data.shippingAddress.city,
          state: data.shippingAddress.state,
          postal_code: data.shippingAddress.postal_code,
          country: data.shippingAddress.country
        }
      }
    };
    
    if (customers.data.length > 0) {
      // Update existing customer with shipping address
      const customer = await stripe.customers.update(customers.data[0].id, customerData);
      customerId = customer.id;
      logger.info('Updated existing Stripe customer with shipping address:', customer.id);
    } else {
      // Create new customer with shipping address
      const customer = await stripe.customers.create(customerData);
      customerId = customer.id;
      logger.info('Created new Stripe customer with shipping address:', customer.id);
    }
  } catch (error: any) {
    logger.warn('Failed to create/update Stripe customer:', error.message);
    // Continue without customer - will use customer_email instead
  }
}

// Set customer (will pre-fill from customer.shipping)
if (customerId) {
  sessionData.customer = customerId;  // ✅ Uses customer with shipping
} else if (data.customerInfo?.email) {
  sessionData.customer_email = data.customerInfo.email;  // ✅ Fallback
}
```

**How it works:**
1. ✅ Finds existing Stripe customer by email
2. ✅ Updates customer's `shipping` field with full address
3. ✅ OR creates new customer if none exists
4. ✅ Passes `customer` ID to checkout session
5. ✅ Stripe automatically pre-fills address from `customer.shipping`

### **3. PayPal - Already Configured Correctly**
**File:** `backend/src/services/paypalService.ts` (Lines 209-233)

**PayPal already had proper address handling:**
```typescript
if (data.shippingAddress) {
  const shippingData: any = {
    name: {
      full_name: data.customerName || 'Customer'
    },
    address: {
      address_line_1: data.shippingAddress.line1,  // ✅ Already correct
      address_line_2: data.shippingAddress.line2 || undefined,
      admin_area_2: data.shippingAddress.city,
      admin_area_1: data.shippingAddress.state,
      postal_code: data.shippingAddress.postal_code,
      country_code: data.shippingAddress.country
    }
  };
  
  requestBody.purchase_units[0].shipping = shippingData;
}
```

**With `shipping_preference: 'SET_PROVIDED_ADDRESS'`:**
- ✅ Address is locked and pre-filled
- ✅ Customer cannot change it
- ✅ Now it will have `line1` due to frontend normalization

### **4. Debug Logging Added**
**File:** `frontend/src/ecommerce/routes/Payment.tsx`

**Added comprehensive logging:**

**When Loading Order (Lines 223-242):**
```typescript
console.log('🔍 Raw shipping address from DB:', shippingAddr)
console.log('🔍 Address field names:', shippingAddr ? Object.keys(shippingAddr) : 'null')
// ... normalization ...
console.log('📍 Normalized shipping address:', shippingAddr)
console.log('📍 Address field value:', shippingAddr.address)
```

**When Starting Stripe Checkout (Lines 386-390):**
```typescript
console.log('💳 Starting Stripe checkout with address:', {
  orderId: orderData.id,
  orderNumber: orderData.orderNumber,
  shippingAddress: orderData.shippingAddress
})
```

**When Starting PayPal Checkout (Lines 437-441):**
```typescript
console.log('💳 Starting PayPal checkout with order data:', {
  orderId: orderData.id,
  orderNumber: orderData.orderNumber,
  shippingAddress: orderData.shippingAddress
})
```

**When Sending to PayPal (Lines 488-493):**
```typescript
console.log('📦 PayPal payload being sent:', {
  amount: paypalPayload.amount,
  shippingAddress: paypalPayload.shippingAddress,
  customerInfo: paypalPayload.customerInfo,
  itemsCount: paypalPayload.items.length
})
```

## 🔧 Files Modified

| File | Changes | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `frontend/src/ecommerce/routes/Payment.tsx` | Address normalization, validation, debug logging | Maps database field names to payment gateway formats |
| `backend/src/services/stripeService.ts` | Customer creation/update with shipping | Enables Stripe address pre-fill |
| `backend/src/services/paypalService.ts` | Already correct | PayPal was already configured properly |

---

## 💡 Why This Fix Works

### **The Core Issue:**
- **Database stores:** `{ address: "123 North High Street", ... }`
- **Payment gateways expect:** `{ line1: "123 North High Street", ... }`
- **Result:** `line1` was `undefined`, address not pre-filled

### **The Solution:**
1. ✅ **Frontend normalization:** Maps `address` → `line1`
2. ✅ **Stripe customer:** Saves address on customer object
3. ✅ **PayPal payload:** Sends correct `line1` field
4. ✅ **Validation:** Catches missing fields early
5. ✅ **Debug logging:** Shows exactly what's happening
