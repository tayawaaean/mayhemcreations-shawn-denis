# Unified Orders Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a unified orders system where `order_reviews` table serves as the single source of truth for all order stages, from pending review through to delivery.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Enhancement

**Added to `order_reviews` table:**
- `order_number` - Unique order identifier (generated after payment)
- `shipping_address` - Customer shipping address (JSON)
- `billing_address` - Customer billing address (JSON)
- `payment_method` - Payment method used (card, etc.)
- `payment_status` - Payment processing status (pending, completed, etc.)
- `payment_provider` - Payment gateway (stripe, paypal, etc.)
- `payment_intent_id` - Stripe payment intent ID
- `transaction_id` - Full transaction reference
- `card_last4` - Last 4 digits of payment card
- `card_brand` - Card brand (Visa, Mastercard, etc.)
- `tracking_number` - Shipping tracking number
- `shipping_carrier` - Shipping carrier name
- `shipped_at` - Timestamp when shipped
- `delivered_at` - Timestamp when delivered
- `estimated_delivery_date` - Expected delivery date
- `customer_notes` - Notes from customer
- `internal_notes` - Internal admin notes

**Migration Script:** `backend/src/scripts/addPaymentFieldsToOrderReviews.ts`

### 2. Backend Updates

**File: `backend/src/controllers/webhookController.ts`**
- Modified Stripe webhook handler to update `order_reviews` with payment and shipping details instead of creating separate orders
- Payment info is now saved directly to the order review record
- Generates order number after successful payment
- Stores shipping/billing address from payment metadata

**Key Changes:**
- Removed `createOrderFromReview` function call
- Added direct UPDATE query to `order_reviews` with payment details
- Better error handling and logging

### 3. Frontend Updates

**File: `frontend/src/admin/pages/PendingReview.tsx`**
- Added new "Payment & Shipping Details" section to order detail modal
- Displays payment info only after payment is completed (when `order_number` exists)
- Shows:
  - Order number
  - Payment status with color-coded badge
  - Payment method and card details
  - Transaction ID
  - Full shipping address
  - Tracking information (when available)

**UI Improvements:**
- Green bordered card for payment/shipping section
- Conditional rendering - only shows after payment
- Clean layout with grid for payment details
- Separate sections for address and tracking

### 4. Data Flow

**Before Payment:**
```
1. Customer submits cart for review → order_reviews (status: pending)
2. Admin reviews → order_reviews (status: approved → pending-payment)
3. Customer completes payment → separate orders table created
```

**After Implementation:**
```
1. Customer submits cart for review → order_reviews (status: pending)
2. Admin reviews → order_reviews (status: approved → pending-payment)
3. Customer completes payment → order_reviews updated with payment/shipping data
   - order_number generated
   - payment details saved
   - shipping address saved
   - status → approved-processing
```

## Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth:** All order data in one table eliminates data duplication
2. **Complete Order History:** Track orders from submission to delivery in one place
3. **Simpler Admin UI:** No need to cross-reference multiple tables
4. **Better Data Consistency:** Payment and shipping info directly linked to order review
5. **Easier Reporting:** Query one table for complete order analytics
6. **Maintains Workflow:** Pending review process stays intact, now extended with payment data

## Order Stages

The `order_reviews` table now supports the complete order lifecycle:

1. **pending** - Awaiting admin review
2. **approved** - Admin approved, transitions to pending-payment
3. **pending-payment** - Waiting for customer payment
4. **approved-processing** - Payment completed, ready for fulfillment
5. **in-production** - Being manufactured
6. **ready-for-checkout** - Ready to ship
7. **shipped** - Shipped to customer
8. **delivered** - Delivered to customer

## Admin View

The admin "Pending Review" section now functions as a unified "Orders" view showing:
- All orders regardless of stage
- Full order details including product customization
- Payment and shipping info (after payment)
- Tracking information (after shipping)
- Complete order history in one place

## Testing Recommendations

1. Submit a new order for review
2. Admin approves the order
3. Customer completes payment
4. Verify payment/shipping details appear in admin modal
5. Update tracking info
6. Verify all stages display correctly

## Migration Notes

- Existing `orders` table can be kept for historical data or removed
- All new orders use the enhanced `order_reviews` table
- No data loss - all embroidery options, mockups, and pricing retained
- Frontend already configured to handle the new fields

## Files Modified

**Backend:**
- `backend/src/scripts/addPaymentFieldsToOrderReviews.ts` (new)
- `backend/src/scripts/addPaymentFieldsToOrderReviews.sql` (new)
- `backend/src/controllers/webhookController.ts`

**Frontend:**
- `frontend/src/admin/pages/PendingReview.tsx`

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. Rename "Pending Review" to "Orders" in navigation
2. Add filtering by payment status
3. Add export functionality for paid orders
4. Consider archiving old separate `orders` table
5. Add bulk update features for tracking numbers
