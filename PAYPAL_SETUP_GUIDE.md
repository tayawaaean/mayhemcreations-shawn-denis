## üß™ Testing

### 1. Sandbox Testing

Use PayPal's sandbox environment for testing:

1. **Test Accounts**: PayPal provides test buyer and seller accounts
2. **Test Cards**: Use PayPal's test credit card numbers
3. **Test Flow**: Complete the full payment flow in sandbox mode

### 2. Test Scenarios

Test the following scenarios:

- ‚úÖ Successful PayPal payment
- ‚úÖ PayPal payment cancellation
- ‚úÖ PayPal payment failure
- ‚úÖ Invalid order data
- ‚úÖ Network errors
- ‚úÖ Authentication errors

### 3. PayPal Test Cards

For testing with PayPal's hosted checkout:

- **Successful Payment**: Use any valid test card
- **Declined Payment**: Use PayPal's test decline scenarios
- **3D Secure**: Test with cards requiring additional authentication

## üîí Security Considerations

### 1. Environment Variables

- Never commit real PayPal credentials to version control
- Use different credentials for development and production
- Rotate credentials regularly

### 2. Webhook Security

- Implement proper webhook signature verification
- Use HTTPS for webhook endpoints
- Validate webhook payloads

### 3. Data Handling

- Don't store sensitive payment data
- Use PayPal's secure token system
- Implement proper error handling

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### 1. Switch to Production Environment

Update environment variables:

```env
PAYPAL_ENVIRONMENT=production
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_live_client_id
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_live_client_secret
VITE_PAYPAL_ENVIRONMENT=production
VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_live_client_id
```

### 2. Update URLs

Update success and cancel URLs to production domains:

```env
PAYPAL_SUCCESS_URL=https://yourdomain.com/payment/success
PAYPAL_CANCEL_URL=https://yourdomain.com/payment/cancel
```

### 3. Webhook Configuration

- Update webhook URL to production domain
- Ensure webhook endpoint is accessible
- Test webhook delivery

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"PayPal service not initialized"**
   - Check PayPal client ID configuration
   - Verify environment variables are set

2. **"Failed to create PayPal order"**
   - Check backend PayPal credentials
   - Verify API endpoint is accessible
   - Check request payload format

3. **"Payment capture failed"**
   - Verify order ID is valid
   - Check PayPal order status
   - Ensure proper authentication

4. **Webhook not receiving events**
   - Verify webhook URL is accessible
   - Check webhook configuration in PayPal dashboard
   - Test webhook endpoint manually

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:

```typescript
// In PayPal service
console.log('PayPal configuration:', paypalConfig);
console.log('Order creation request:', orderData);
console.log('Order creation response:', result);
```
