# Orders Section Unification - Complete

## Summary
Successfully unified the orders management by removing the separate "Orders" page and renaming "Pending Review" to "Orders". The system now uses a single, comprehensive orders view.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Files
- ✅ `frontend/src/admin/pages/Orders.tsx` - Deleted (separate orders page no longer needed)

### 2. Updated Sidebar Navigation

**File: `frontend/src/admin/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`**
- Removed "Pending Review" menu item
- "Orders" now points to the unified view (previously Pending Review)
- Combined notification badges (orders + updates)

**File: `frontend/src/admin/components/layout/SellerSidebar.tsx`**
- Same changes for seller interface

### 3. Updated Routes

**File: `frontend/src/admin/AdminApp.tsx`**
- Removed `Orders` component import
- Route `/admin/orders` now uses `PendingReview` component
- Removed `/admin/pending-review` route

**File: `frontend/src/admin/SellerApp.tsx`**
- Same routing changes for seller interface

## How It Works Now

### Navigation
```
Before:
- Orders & Customers
  - Orders (separate page)
  - Pending Review (main functionality)
  - Customers
  - Reviews

After:
- Orders & Customers
  - Orders (unified view with all functionality)
  - Customers
  - Reviews
```

### Routing
```
Before:
/admin/orders → Orders.tsx (separate page)
/admin/pending-review → PendingReview.tsx (main page)

After:
/admin/orders → PendingReview.tsx (unified page with all features)
```

### Features in Unified Orders View

The "Orders" section now shows:
1. ✅ All order stages (pending → approved → paid → shipped → delivered)
2. ✅ Complete order details with embroidery options, pricing, mockups
3. ✅ Payment information (after payment completed)
4. ✅ Shipping address and tracking details
5. ✅ Picture reply and customer confirmation workflow
6. ✅ Status updates and admin notes
7. ✅ Real-time WebSocket updates

## Database Architecture

**Single Source of Truth: `order_reviews` table**

Contains all data from submission to delivery:
- Initial order submission (status: pending)
- Admin review process
- Payment details (added after payment)
- Shipping information
- Tracking updates
- Complete order history

## Benefits

1. **Simpler Navigation** - One place for all order management
2. **No Data Duplication** - Everything in `order_reviews` table
3. **Complete Order View** - See full lifecycle in one place
4. **Better UX** - Less confusion about where to find orders
5. **Maintains Workflow** - All existing functionality preserved

## User Impact

### Admins
- Click "Orders" to see all orders at any stage
- Filter by status to find specific orders
- View complete details including payment/shipping when available
- Same great features, simpler navigation

### Sellers
- Same unified experience
- Access all order management from one place

## Technical Notes

- The `PendingReview` component name is kept in code for backward compatibility
- Frontend displays as "Orders" in navigation
- All APIs and backend logic unchanged
- WebSocket notifications combined for unified count
