# Fix: Vite Cache Error - RESOLVED

## ✅ What I Did

Cleared Vite's cache to fix the phantom `TestAddressSelector.tsx` error.

## 🚀 Next Steps

**1. Restart your frontend dev server:**

```powershell
# If server is running, stop it (Ctrl + C)
# Then restart:
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

**2. Hard refresh browser:**
```
Ctrl + Shift + R
```

**3. Test checkout again!**

## ⚠️ If Error Persists

Run these commands:

```powershell
# Stop dev server (Ctrl + C)

# Go to frontend folder
cd C:\Users\tayaw\Desktop\Projects\mayhem-creations\frontend

# Clear all caches
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules\.vite
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force dist

# Restart
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 About Address Validation

**Your Question:** "Can I have a dropdown with all valid US addresses?"

**Answer:** No - there are 150+ million addresses! 

**Better Solutions:**

### **Option 1: Google Places Autocomplete (Best for Production)**
```
npm install @react-google-maps/api
```
- Real-time address suggestions as user types
- Auto-fills city, state, ZIP
- Industry standard (Amazon, eBay use this)
- Free tier: 25,000 requests/month

### **Option 2: Address Validation with Suggestions (Current)**
- ShipEngine validates addresses automatically
- Shows "Address not found" error if invalid
- Customer fixes the address themselves

### **Option 3: Test Mode Quick-Fill (For Development)**
- Dropdown with 5-10 test addresses
- Only shows in development mode
- Quick testing without typing

## 💡 Recommendation

**For Now:**
- ✅ Use the test addresses I provided
- ✅ Type them manually
- ✅ Get the basic flow working

**For Production (Later):**
- Add Google Places Autocomplete
- Improves user experience
- Reduces address errors
- Industry standard solution
