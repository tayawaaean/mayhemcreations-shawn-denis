# Placement Notes Display Fix

## Issue
Placement notes were not appearing in the order reviews modal under "My Orders" on the customer side. When customers viewed their order details, the placement instructions they had added for each design were missing from the customization details section.

## Root Cause
In the `MyOrders.tsx` file, the order details modal was displaying the list of design names but not including the individual placement notes (`design.notes`) that customers had entered for each design during the customization process.

## Solution
Updated the customization details section in `frontend/src/ecommerce/routes/MyOrders.tsx` (lines 2380-2418) to:

1. Changed the design list item from a simple `<p>` tag to a `<div>` wrapper to allow nested content
2. Added conditional rendering to display `design.notes` as placement instructions under each design name
3. Formatted the placement notes with:
   - Italic styling for visual distinction
   - Indentation for hierarchy
   - Bold "Placement:" label for clarity

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/ecommerce/routes/MyOrders.tsx` - Added placement notes display in order details modal

## Implementation Details

### Before:
```tsx
{(item.customization as any).designs.map((design: any, index: number) => (
  <p key={design.id || index} className="ml-4 text-xs">
    • {design.name || `Design ${index + 1}`}
  </p>
))}
```

### After:
```tsx
{(item.customization as any).designs.map((design: any, index: number) => (
  <div key={design.id || index} className="ml-4 mb-2">
    <p className="text-xs font-medium text-gray-700">
      • {design.name || `Design ${index + 1}`}
    </p>
    {design.notes && (
      <p className="text-xs text-gray-600 ml-4 mt-1 italic">
        <strong>Placement:</strong> {design.notes}
      </p>
    )}
  </div>
))}
```

## Verification
The placement notes now appear in:
- ✅ Customer Order Details Modal (MyOrders.tsx) - FIXED
- ✅ Admin Pending Review Page (PendingReview.tsx) - Already working
- ✅ Cart Preview (Cart.tsx) - Already working

## User Experience Impact
Customers can now see their placement instructions when reviewing their orders, providing:
- Confirmation that their placement notes were saved
- Reference for what they requested
- Transparency in the order review process

## Data Structure
Placement notes are stored in the `design.notes` field within each design object:
```typescript
{
  designs: [
    {
      id: string,
      name: string,
      notes: string,  // Placement instructions
      dimensions: { width: number, height: number },
      position: { x: number, y: number, placement: string },
      // ... other fields
    }
  ]
}
```
