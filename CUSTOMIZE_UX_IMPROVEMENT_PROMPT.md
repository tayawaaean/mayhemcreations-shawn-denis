# Product Customization UI/UX Improvement Prompt

## Current System Overview
The customize section is an embroidery product customization system with these main steps:
1. **Product Selection** - Choose color and size
2. **Design Upload** - Upload embroidery designs
3. **Design Positioning** - Position designs and add notes
4. **Embroidery Options** - Select coverage, material, border, threads, backing, upgrades, cutting
5. **Review & Cart** - Final review and add to cart

## Target Users
**Non-technical users** who may not understand:
- File formats and size requirements
- Technical embroidery terminology
- Design positioning concepts
- Pricing calculations

## Improvement Areas

### 1. SIMPLIFIED LANGUAGE & CLEARER INSTRUCTIONS

**Current Issues:**
- Technical terms like "coverage," "backing," "cutting method" without context
- Minimal guidance on what users should do at each step
- No explanation of how choices affect the final product

**Requirements:**
- Replace technical jargon with simple, everyday language
- Add "What is this?" tooltips with plain English explanations for every option
- Include visual examples showing what each option looks like on the final product
- Use friendly, conversational tone (e.g., "Let's customize your design!" instead of "Select customization options")
- Add a glossary modal accessible from any step explaining embroidery terms in simple language
- Show real product photos demonstrating different options (coverage levels, border styles, etc.)

**Examples of Language Improvements:**
- "Coverage" → "How much of your design should we embroider?" with visual slider showing 50%, 75%, 100%
- "Backing Support" → "Do you need extra support? (Good for heavy fabrics or frequently washed items)"
- "Cutting Method" → "How should we finish the edges?" with photos of each method

2. "What would you click first when you see this page?"
3. "Is anything confusing or unclear?"
4. "Did you know how much this would cost before seeing the total?"
5. "Were you confident in your choices when adding to cart?"
6. "On a scale of 1-10, how easy was this to use?"
7. "What would make this easier?"
8. "Did you encounter any errors? Were they helpful?"

---

## CONCLUSION

The goal is to transform the customization experience from a technical form into an intuitive, guided journey that:

✅ Makes non-technical users feel confident
✅ Prevents mistakes before they happen  
✅ Provides clear, helpful guidance at every step
✅ Shows exactly what users will receive
✅ Eliminates confusion about pricing
✅ Works perfectly on mobile devices
✅ Feels modern, friendly, and professional

Focus on **clarity over cleverness** and **guidance over assumptions**. Every interaction should answer the question: "What do I do next, and why?"
